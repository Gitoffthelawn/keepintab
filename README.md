# KeepInTab
WebExtension to prevent links to open in a new tab/window.
This extension removes every target attributes from links except named targets (referring to an existing window or iframe).

This is a webextension-compatible version of [TargetKiller](https://addons.mozilla.org/fr/firefox/addon/targetkiller/) which I used for a long time !
