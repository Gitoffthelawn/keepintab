# KeepInTab
WebExtension to prevent links to open in a new tab/window.
This extension removes every target attributes from links except named targets (referring to an existing window or iframe).

Available for Firefox here: https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/keepintab/

This is a webextension-compatible version of TargetKiller which I used for a long time!
